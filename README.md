# ALTTPR Item Sender

A quick and dirty web tool to send items to an ALttPR game using the multiworld implementation.

This tool requires SNI. This tool requires a DR seed.

This tools is very obviously illegal to use in races, unless the format of the race requires it.

## How to use:
1. Start SNI - (q)usb2snes will NOT work
2. If you have multiple devices, select the device you want to connect in the menu in the top right.
3. Click Item - Receive Item
